Notes for self:

- Set up environment with `uv install`.
- Use an invocation like `uv run ptw . year2023/day01` to re-run tests on file changes.
- Run the top-level script with `python3 -m year2023.day01 <./year2023/day01/input`.
- Use [`aoc-cli`](https://docs.rs/crate/aoc-cli/latest) to interact with the website:
  - Download an input file with e.g. `aoc download -I --input-file ./year2023/day01/input`.
